- There are more than 1000 workers dying each year of workplace accidents and 340, 000 suffer lost-time injuries.

Something is 165,000 ?

- More than half of workplace fatalities are attributable to occupational diseases.

**Definitions**

- Lost-time injury: a workplace injury that results in employees missing time from work;

- Occupation Health and Safety: the identification. evaluation and control of hazards associated with the work environment;

- Occupational Injury: Any cut, fracture, sprain or amputation resulting from a workplace accident;

- Occupational Illness: Any abnormal condition or disorder caused by exposure to environmental factors associated with employment.


**Development of Occupational Health and Safety**

- Occupational injureies date back to ancient Egypt where stonemasons and potters experience respiratory problems;

- The industrial revolution brought about brown lung disease(Excessive inhalation of dust);

- Ontario was the first to pass legislation in the 19th century establishing safety standards such as machine guarding;

- By the early 20th century every province had factory laws regulating heating, lighting, ventilation, hygiene, fire safety, and accident reporting. Factory inspectors enforced these standards and conducted regular inspections.

**Workplace Rights**
1. The right to refuse unsafe work without penalty;
2. The right to participate in identifying and correcting health and safety problems.
3. The right to know about hazards in the workplace.

**Mad Hatters**
In the 19th century the mad hatters would use mecurous nitrate to cure felt. It wasn't until the 20th century that they discovered this.

Until the 20th century the dominant model of dealing with the hazards was the legal doctrine of the assumption of risk:

- The belief that a worker accepted the risls of employment when he or she accepted a job.

- Employers bore little or no responsibility for health and safety and were not responsible for providing compensation to injured workers unless the accident was soley the fault of the employer.

- Associated with the assumption of risk doctrine was the belief that occupational injuries were caused by worker carelessness;

- The concept of accident proneness assumed that some individuals are inherently more likely than others to be involved in accidents due to individual charcteristics.

- Employers, employees, and the public should care about ocupational health and safety for economic, legal and moral reasons.

**Economic Considerations:**
- Economic costs of a work related injury has two components - direct and indirect cost.

**Legal considerations:**
- Every worker has the right to safe working conditions

- Section 25 of the OH&S Act requires am employer "to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker" - (Known as **due diligence**)

    - Due dilligence requires a business to forsee al unsafe conditions or acts and requires it to take precautions to prevent accidents that can be reasonably anticipated.
    - Due dilligence requires a worker to work in compliance with health and safety legislation.

**Moral considerations:**

- Employers have an obligation to ensure safe working environemtns for employees and their families.

- Research indicates that management commitment to OH&S results in higher level of worker safety.

**The Stakeholders**
- The workmens compensation act was passed in 1914 in Ontario providing lost wages to almost every injured worker, removing the right of workers to sue their employers;

    - To Ensure that injured workers recieved compensation and that employers accept liability and;
    - to prevent accidents and ilness through safe work environment establishment.


**Employers**
- The employer is responsible for preparing a written occupational health and safety policy and ensuring that it is prominently displayed in the workplace.

- Employers are required to:
    - Provide and maintain equipment materials and protective devices
    - Ensure that the manner in which work is performed is safe and the environment free from hazards and risks
    - Monitor their workplace and report minor, critical, disabling and fatal injuries.
    - Monitor for environment and occupational illnesses and toxi substances.
    - Establish health and safety commitees with st

**Employees:**
- As individuals employees are required to:
    - perform their duties and tasks in a safe and a responsible manner and to wear protective equipment in compliance with company and legal requirements;
    - to report defective equipment and other workplace hazards to safety professionals or JHSC's
    - The right to refuse unsafe work.

**Organized Labour:**
- Roles of organized labour include:
    - Bringing emerging problems and issues in health and safety to the attention of government and employers and pressure other stakeholders to take corrective action;
    - Use the collective bargaining process to incorporate health and safety provisions in contracts
    - Fomralize voluntary measures and extend legislative programs

**Partnerships**
- Barries to safety programs
    - Employers are concerned with production quotas than safety records.
    - Employers may be unaware of the methods and instruments to rigorously monitor the workplace
    - Work climates emphasizing conflic between management and the union
    - Medical establishments not well versed in occupational medicine.
- Ways to overcome barriers:
    - Form alliances amongst stakeholders
    - All parties have the same goal to reduce inuries and illnesses
    - Win-win situations in bargaining

**Health and safety Professionals**
- Employing a health and safety proffessional can produce returns equal to factors of two or more times the salary paid.

- **Traditional views of safety emphasize the three E's: engineering, education and enforcement.**

    - Engineering solutions to ensure safe work environments, equipment, and personal protective devices.
    - Educating supervisors and employers in the use of equipment.
    - Enforcing existing regulations and practices through health and safety practices.

**The Role Of Human Resources**
- The three E's did not provide a total solution and now OH&S is managed exclusively under the human resource function

- Reasons for this include:
    - Safety is a people issue
    - Safety requires legislative compliance
    - Safety decreases costs
    - Safety relates to other human resource functions.
